 RAReQS is a solver for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs). The solver tackles the given formula
 recursively using counterexample abstraction refinement (CEGAR). More details can be found in our
 SAT 2012 paper [1]. While the RAReQS algorithm [1] is applicable to any QBF in the prenex form, the
 current implementation supports only the QDIMACS format.
